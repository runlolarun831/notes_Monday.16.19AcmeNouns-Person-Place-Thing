Video #1 What is Sequelize?
-library you install

-sits on tops of other database drivers
Sequelize sits on top of pg node module
-have to install both Sequelize and postgres
-it can work ontop of other databases as well

Sequelize is ORM
-Object Relational Model
  -you define your Model
  -you define properties on your Model

  instead of writing in Seqelize you let the ORM do the work for you so you don't have to manually do it.
  It sits ontop of you data layer, becomes part of it

  Important!
  -the order in which you drop and create tables
  -have to define your own rlationships
  -we will generate some of the models that will generate
  all of the SQL????
